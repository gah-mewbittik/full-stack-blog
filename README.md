# Full-Stack-Blog

## Building a Full-Stack Blog

The purpose of this project is to create a full-stack blog. This means the development of the front-end (Client-side) and the back-end (Server-side). In the application, the user is presented with a home, dashboard, and login pages. Developing this project demonstrates our full-stack development skills using Mysql2, Nodejs, Express js, Dotenv, Bcrypt, Express-handlebars, Express-sessions, connect-session-sequelize, Heroku, and Sequelize.

This project was developed with Sequelize version ^6.37.0 Using Sequelize assisted in forming and structuring of the database models. Along with forming the models, Sequelize was used for seeding, and the management of data. Insomnia was used to implement Express js methods.
